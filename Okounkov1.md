# 3d gauge theory and elliptic stable envelopes

$\Ell(\pt/G) = degree-0 semistable $G$-bundles onthe dual elliptic curve $E^\vee$.  Covariant in $G$ and $E$.

$\Ell(\pt/U(1)) = \Pic_0(E^\vee) = $

$\Ell(\pt/U(r)) = \Sym^r E$ elliptic Chern roots

This is supposed to be deep: Thom sheaf $\Theta(-V)$ is a nontrivial line bundle.  

Elliptic cohomology is built out of sections of line bundles
