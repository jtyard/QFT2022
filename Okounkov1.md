# 3d gauge theory and elliptic stable envelopes
$\def\Ell{\mathrm{Ell}}$ 
$\def\pt{\mathrm{pt}}$
$\def\Sym{\mathrm{Sym}}$

$\Ell(\pt/G) = degree-0 semistable $G$-bundles onthe dual elliptic curve $E^\vee$.  Covariant in $G$ and $E$.

$\Ell(\pt/U(1)) = \Pic_0(E^\vee) = $

$\Ell(\pt/U(r)) = \Sym^r E$ elliptic Chern roots

This is supposed to be deep: Thom sheaf $\Theta(-V)$ is a nontrivial line bundle.  

Elliptic cohomology is built out of sections of line bundles



Degree of a line bundle on $E^n$ is not a number but a symmetric integer matrix in $\Sym^2 Z^n$.

Holy shit it is really looking like
