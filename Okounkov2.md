$$Maps(\Sigma \to XX) = QM = \cup_d QM_d$$

Trace, index, $\chi$, pushforward in K-theory all refer to the same thing:

$$Z = \int z^{deg} g \hat A(QM) \prod_{\textrm{marked points}} ev_1^*(\textrm{some K-class})$$

QM on this space is like index of virtual Dirac operators $\hat A$.  ALso need local operators at marked points as $K_{G_F}(pt)[[z]]$ or even a K-theory class on moduli of surfact + G_F bundle.  

Three types of marked points / line defects

- Square: At such points we evaluate to the stack XX. Singularities can go there.  
- Diamond: At such points evaluate to X.  If a singularity of map tries to get there, it must bubble off.
- Circle:  Not OK to have a singularity go there.  Open condition.

THe diamond type points have to do with quantum loop groups and involves fundamental soluntion of some QKZ-like q-difference equations in all variables (both Kahler & equiv).

Study a map from K(X) to K(XX).  Has a part K(X) -> K(X) consisting of
Bethe eigenfunctions.  Another part K(tilde XX) and another having to do with elliptic cohomology.


Missed a lot.. 


There are two kinds of R_matrices.
