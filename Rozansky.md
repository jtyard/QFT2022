# Rozansky

He has notes online

## The category of matrix factorizations 


At the very end he draws a single gauged vertex with a self-loop $T^* gl_n ///GL_n$.
derived Steinberg variety Bezrukavnikov-Riche $Br_n^{aff} \to End(A)$ 

Origin of the work with Oblomkov towards link homology (the first thing he'll talk about on Friday)

Note the aux variety happens to symplectic and the superpotential has a very special form.  Comes form a 3-category that appears in Kapustin-Witten (which is fact actually a 4-category).
