# Discussion Thursday

Sasha's question: Twisted theories - what is the right language to talk about them?  I.e. when the dual of the Symplectic group is symplectic.  4d theories labeled by a Lie algbera and some global topological data.  


Lines labeled by a weight and a coweight (modulo the Weyl group) 

Need a way to talk about dyonic lines (KW / Wilson-'t Hooft lines)/

Cartan torus modulo dual cartan torus modulo a lattice 

Get category of reps of quantum group at root of unity - there are two main versions 

- Lusztig w or wo divided powers 
- Kac de Conini 

Consider the form where you have divided powers in one half and don't in the other.  

q contains the information in the differential that remains topological in the bulk.  

KL-form at a root of unity is when you keep the A-twist (psi = 0) and consider Neumann boundary conditions complemented with k units of Chern-Simons coupling Rep_q(G) so there is a (1,k) 5-brane on the right.  This is a corner vertex algebra.  They also seaid Lens space.  

Under duality it goes to a (k,1)-brane (about which we know very little).

Davide: WIth quantum geometric langlands ou can go from psi=k with a Neumann boundary and get psi = 1/k with a Nahm pole boundary condition.
