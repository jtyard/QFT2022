3D N=2 is just 4d N=2 broken down by compactifying on circle. 

3d N+1 is SQM into XX = Maps(E_tau,X) 

$Q^2 = D_{\bar z}$

$\mathcal{Q} = \bar Q_+ + Q_+$ (first one is the one used in the HT twist)


Missed a bunch.

Now the half index.  Physically, computed by certain path integral, there are some background fields...

Stretch capped off circle into a long cigar.  Consider cigar partition function for A-twists and you get an object that goes under many names - vortex function, homological block... 

...

Ends with telling how to get XXX and XXZ spin chains.  

Draws T^L = oplus_{N=0}^L framed(L) connected to gauged(N)

Framed L means L boxes.  G = U(N).  From a paper [Quantum groups and quantum cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1287) mentioned elsewhere in this workshop.  cod
