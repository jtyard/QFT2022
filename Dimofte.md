# 3d theories and twists II

Physical scenarios mapped to mathematical structures such that physical dualities mapped to conjectures relating such structures. 

Want to find some intermediate mathematical field/string theory.  Some kind of S-sector or cohomological structure is often enough. 

Once we have a mathematical definition of some BPS sector of the theory we an start defining the objects more precisely than in the purely physical scenario. 


-4d N=4 has EM duality and a topological twist -> geometric Langlands 
-4d N=2 has webs of EM-like dualities has holomorphic topological twist -> Seiberg-Witten geometry, Hitchin systems, Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing, VOAs, AGT correspondence. 
- 3d N=4 has 3d mirror symmetry -> after a topological twist expect to find a lift of homological mirror symmetry and applications to knot homology, applic and extensions of symplectic duality.  Holomorphic-topological twists of 3d N=4 gives elliptic cohomology in hyperkahler setting (explained by Dedushenko-Nekrasov...)
- 3d N=2 doesn't have a topological twist.  It has vast big webs of dualities.  Has a HT twist.  Elliptic cohomolgy of hyperkahler spaces.  Topological invariants $T[M^3]$ of 3-manifolds 3d-3d correspondence.  Categorification of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.
