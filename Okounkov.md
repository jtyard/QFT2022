$\Ell(\pt/G) = degree-0 semistable $G$-bundles onthe dual elliptic curve $E^\vee$.  Covariant in $G$ and $E$.

$\Ell(\pt/U(1)) = \Pic_0(E^\vee) = $

$\Ell(\pt/U(r)) = \Sym^r E$ elliptic Chern roots

This is supposed to be deep: Thom sheaf $\Theta(-V)$ is a nontrivial line bundle.  

Elliptic cohomology is built out of sections of line bundles on sheaves.  But those sheaves have nontrivial cohomology.



Degree of a line bundle on $E^n$ is not a number but a symmetric integer matrix in $\Sym^2 Z^n$.

On Thursday he will talk about Kahler varieties.  There are 2 kinds of hyperplane arrangements exchanged by mirror symmetry.  THe poles in (??) regarding hyperplane arrangements turns out to be where the some line bundle is trivial.
