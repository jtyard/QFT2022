## 4 BOundary structure and relative $d$-orientation

EOM updated to a functor from cobordisms to Lagrangian correspondences

Want to show $\partial M_B \hookrightarrow M_B \Rightarrow EOM(M_B) \hookrightarrow EOM(\partial M_B)$

$f: \gamma \to \Sigma$ , $[\gamma] : \Gamma(\gamma,O_Y) \to C[d]$

There is a notion of a nondegenerate boundary structure.  See [Calaque](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3235) 

Theorem: Calaque, H S turn EOM(-) into a functor from nCob to nLagCorr.

Ex: Inside relative chain $H^d(M,\partial M) \to H^{d-1}(\partial M)$ , 
$[M] \mapsto [\partial M]$

## 

Geometric quantization functor is mostly just an ansatz.  

Ends with an example this ansatz in going from $nLagCorr$ to $nCat_C$.

Ex: Suppose want to study BCs in AKSZ theory

given $\partial M \hookrightarrow M$ , BCs are Lagrangians $B$ in $EOM(\partial M)$
