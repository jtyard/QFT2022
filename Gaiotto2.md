# Holomorphic BF Theory and geometric Langlands

- Global geometric langlands is an equivalence of categories between 
flat connections on Bun(C,G) and  bundles on Flat(C,G') 

- 4d A and B twisted N=4 SYM are tqfts related by S-duality.  Attach categories Z_A(C,G) and Z_B(C,G') to a Riemann surface  C.

- Holomorphic vs topological - GL categories use complex structure of C.  Though the whole theory must be topological, the defects or other objects inside the category may be holomorphic on C.  

## 2d vs 4d primer 
- B-twisted 2d theory of maps into M 
    - Z[pt] = derived category of coherent sheaves
- 4d ZB(C,G) <-> sd Z(p1) for M = Flat(C,G)
- A-twisted 2d theory of maps into T^*M 
    - Z(p1) is the derived category of D-modules on M
- 4d ZB(C,G ) <-> 2d Z(pt) for T^M = Higgs(C,G)

- 2d is a poor approximation of 4d
- 4d harder but but possible mathematically
- 4d has extra structure such as locality on C
- The category Z(C) has special elements, some have known S duals
    - 3d topological boundaries
    - 3d holomorphic-topological boundaries
    - Z(U_3) where C is the boundary of U_3

## Half-BPS boundaries
- PReserve 3d N=4 in 4d N=4 (spherical varieties?  more later)
- Standard embedding 4d A/B twist -> 3d A/B twist
    - Topological boundary condition
- Alternative embedding - ht boundary
    - inherited from h twist
    - requires deformation, rarely available

## A-twist, HT Neumann
- 4d halfspace with ht-Neumann <-> perturbative 3d ht BF theory
    - Many 4d calculatinos reduce to 3d BF theory.
- Analog of canonical coisotropic brnae in 2d
    - Phase spaced of BF theoryu <-> Higgs(C,G)
- 1d 't Hooft lines ending on HT Neumann <-> local operators in 3d HT BF
    - Hecke correspondence on Higgs(C,G)

There are loop corrections that must also be computed.

## B-twist, HT Nahm
- FOrces flat connection on C to be an oper
    - SL2: $D_t s= 0$, $D_{\bar{z}} s = 0$, $s\wedge D_z s = 1 \to D_z^2 s + t(z) s = 0$
    - Other groups: ht $s$ with constraints on derivatives
- 1d Wilson lines ending on HT-Nahm (Nahm pole singularity)
    - SL2 Fundamental, s(z) endpoint
    - Irrep R (derived Satake) -> D-module S_R on C depending on t(z), etc.

## S-duality I
- HT-Neumann and HT-Nahm should be S dual
    - Same paces of local operators, endpoints of lines, etc
- A: P(B)-gauge-invariant local operators and their fermionic partners
    - Quantize to $\hat{P}(\delta/\delta A_\bar{z})$ quantum HItchin hamiltonians
    - Not obvious because loop corrections could have obstructed
- B: $t(z)$, ... , functions on opers for the dual group.  BD: same as quantum Hitchin Hamitonians

## S-duality II
- Endpoint of lines?
- B: S_R
- A: Phase space is $T^*Gr_G/G[[z]]$
    - Quantize to equivariant D-modules on affine Grasmannian
    - Functor to 
???

Opers are apparently related to the Omega deformation???

## Critical Kac-Moody
- Dirichlet bcs for 3d BF Theory
    - Lifts to HT-Neumann topological Dirichlet corner
- Supportts KM at crtical level B(z) -> \delta/\delta A_\bar{z}-> J(z)
- HT-Neumann local operators <-> Center of critical KM
- BOundary 't Hooft operators 
???

## Topological Nahm
- Hitchin section boundary condition for 3d BF theory
    - SL2: $D_\bar{z} v = 0$, $v\wedge \Phi v = 1$
- Chiral algebra: DS reduction of critical KM
    - Classical W-algebra see t(z) directly
- S-dual to structure sheaf of Flat(C,G')
    - COrner - functions on Oper manifold
- Separation of variables: Dirichlet <-> Nahm + line defects

## Boundary LINEs
- Boundary wilson lines in HT-0Heu <-> WIlson lines in 3d BF
    - Universal bundle on Higgs(G,C) gives wWeyl modules for critical KM
- S-dual to Boundary 't HGoioft lines in HT-Nahm (B-side)
    - Oper with singularity of trivial monodromy
- Gaudin model

## Local GL
- 2-cats Z(circle) of surface defects
- Surface defects meet HT-Heu along topological line
    - BF Wilson line with quantizat5ion of flag manifold or other
    - Higgs bundles with regular or wild ramification
- cKM modules?  Surface - top Dirichlet lines?
- Dual surface defects meet HT-Nahm along topological l;ine
    - Ramified opers

## More HT boundaries
- Interfaces between U(N) and U(M)
- A: holomorphic BF theory for supergroup U(N|M)
- B: N=M $A_\bar{z}= A'_\bar{z}$, $A_z = A_a' + XY$, $D_\bar{z}X = 0$, $D_\bar{z}Y = 0$
- B: N>M Partial oper N -> (N-M) + M identify MxM block
- Mirabolic GL?
- OSp generalizations?

## Topological boundaries
- Enriched Neumann: A/B-twisted 3d N=4 with G-action
- Conformal bnlocks of boundary VOA should give object in Z(C)
    - A: D-module on Bun, B: sheaf on Flat
- Many S-dual pairs from string theory
- More from spherical varieties?
