A: Betti theories have local systems on G... THey involve analytic functions, Fukaya categories, constructible sheaves on X, the Betti space.  


B: On the de Rham side you see flat connections, D-modules on X and coherent sheaves on the dR space.  

Simpson's paper on the nonabelian Hodge correspondence is where defines Betti, dR and Dolbeaux stacks were first defined.  

Higgs_G(X) = Map(X_Dol,B_G)

"Use the HOdge deformation to turn Dol into dR"

Theorem: Ginzburg-Rozenblyum

HT -> A maps EOM_{HT,A}(Sigma x C) to EOM_A(X x C)

Raviolo is the algebraic version of the sphere.  Basically only has one flat connection, with a G's worth of odd deformations. Cohomology of the associated adjoint bundle with cohomology shifted down by one.

Example for a toric variety:  Section of the moment map polarization line bundle involve lattice points in a polytope.
