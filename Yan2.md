4d N=2 U(1) is theory of a single vector multiplet

4d class-S theories are certain N=2 theories... 

- Point in Coulomb branbch is a N-fold branched covering $\tilde C \subset T^*C$ of the SW curve $C$.  

- UV-IR map, "spectral networks"

- Turning on the Omega background on R^2 plane gives a *noncommutative* associative OPE

- Quantum UV-IR map: UV skein algebra -> IR quantum torus algebra (finite Heisenberg algebra!)

aka quantum trace map in the Hitchin moduli space method. 

slide 8 explains in detail the 


IF the 4d N=2 theory is also conformal, the Poisson vertex algebra can eb further quantized by turning on an Omega background, leading to the 2d VOA introduced by

Promoting x and z (momentum/position) to Heisenberg operators gives the Schordinger equation 

$$ (\partial_z^2 + \hbar^{-1} P(z))\psi(z) = 0$$

Solve THAT using the WKB ansatz, which is exact here.  Can we reduce SICs to WKB?
