# Geometric structures in 4d N=2 class S theories

Related to skein theory and inkn invariants, HItchin systems and Exact WKB for ODEs.  

THis talk more about Hitchin systems, bt a talk on MOnday foxues on the other two.  

4d N=2 has 8 supercharges.  Vector multiplet (oneway arrows?) and hypermultiplet (leftrightoarrow?)

Katz-Klemm-Vafa, Gaiotto, GMN on such theories that do not admit a Lagranian decrip ion .  The origin is geometric.

SW curve for 4d N=2 pure SU(2) Yang Mills is indeed a double cover of a sphere branched at four points!  Only regular punctures for A_1.  

Class S theories are 4d N=2 SUSY theories coming from wistsed compactifaations of a 6d (2,0) theory of type ADE on Riemann surface with decorations (punctures or twisted lines).  

Punctures or 0-form symmetry defects associated with automorphisms of the Lie algebra. In A_1 there is only one kind of regular (irregular??) puncture (this talk).  SW curve is a branched covering of $C$ embeddined in $T^*C$ 

Can have irregular punctures above A_1.  (see slide 13)  But in general compute parallel transform and contract together along g-invariant tensors.  

UV-IR map for line defects.  

Irregularity seems to have to do with integrality indeed - see GMN

Recall point on Coulomb branch corresponds to a branched covering (spectral curve / SW curve)

Note these punctures are different than branch points.  FOr instance 4d N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with N_f = 4 fundamental hypermultiplets has C = 4-punctured sphere.

The UV-IR map gives a trace map

Can quantize the SW curve.  Promote x (omentum) and z (position) to Heisenberg operators.  

Then turning on Nekraso-Shtashvili limit of Omega background along the surface defect quantizes the SW curve into Schrodinger eqns or higher rank analouge in a CANONICAL way

Can also derive through the conformal limit [Gaiotto] of the Hitchin moduli space or from the AGT correspondence [AGT], [Alday-Gaiotto-Gukov-Tachikawa-Verlinde](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0945)

Brings us to exact WKB for Scrhodiger euations.  

WKB ansatz involves a lambda(z) obeying the Ricatti equation.
