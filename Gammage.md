# Abelian 3d mirror symmetry and boundary conditions

XX = holomorphic symplectic stack e.g. T^*(V/G), V = variety, G = reductive group

In this talk V is a vector space but more generally using the Venkatesh et al machinery it is helpful for V to be e.g. a spherical variety. 

X leads to a 3d N=4 theory admitting A and B twists. 3d MS relates two 3d N=4 theories such that A-twist of one equiv to B-twist of the other.  

In good cases, each of these theories is specified by an X as above.  Example from Teleman's ICM address: 
$$ X = T^*(BG), X^v = U_\psi\\ T^*G^L //_\psi U $$
For $G = C^\times$ this is just $X^\vee = T^*C^\times$
- particle-gauge duality (pure theory on the left?  MOre later)
Example: $X = T^*(C/C^\times) \Rightarrow X^\vee = T^*C$

The "real duality" is happening on the level of the stacks.  I.e. the Okounkov school of stable quasimaps requires knowing the stack that your variety comes from in the first place.  

[BFN]()'s Coulomb branch construction: E_3-algebra of local operators in the A-twist to X = T^*(V/G) is given by chains on Maps(B,V/G) whichi leads to holomorphic functions on the mirror $X^\vee$
where B is the raviolo.
Later BFN used ideas of Dimofte, Gaiotto, Hilburn,... to give an E_2-category of line operators in the A-twist of $X=T^*(V/G)$, which is related to Dmod(Maps(punctured disc,V/G) ) which gives coherent sheaves on $X^\vee$
Webster, HIlburn-Raskin

NOt study the category of line operators but rather the 2-category of boundary conditions.
