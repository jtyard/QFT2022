Theorem: THe same costruction applies to the more general quiver (which corresponds to the moduli space of (how many?) instantons) (circle with a loop labeled with n and a box with r hanging off) categorifies the cyclotomic Hecke algebra.  n is the number of strands in the braid.  If you wnt to add a CS group you have to add a differential.

when you decategorify you get a variable $a = q^N$ where N is the N of SL_N.

Legendre transform (swap x and y) swaps nilpotent and Borel and gives derived coherent sheaves over derived Grothendieck Steinberg.

Kauffman bracket naturally defined for the "odd version" whereas Jones / RT is naturally defined for the "even version".

Explanation / motivation for the miracles.  WHat does the braid do?  It doesn't move the ponts of the Hilbert scheme around. 

TN = Taub-Nut = two cigars x, y.

Put in N CS M5 branes.  THey reproduce the CS theory om the 3-manifold M3.  Their distribution between the cigars tells us what kind of CS theory. . ON cyg_y is it is the normal CS.

Knot/link M5 branes: uses the conormal bundle instead of M3.  Related to above by Legendre transform.

Assume T^*M3 is small.  Then M-thery reduces to 5d theory on TN x R^1.

Cigars vibrate, vibration is a particle, we count the states of those particles:  that's what link homology is.  They are special BPS particles represented by M2 branes (2dims in cotangent bundle and one along R_t )

THeir approach: Dimofte, Garner, Hilbern, Oblonkov, Rozansky: 

- Turn M2s into D2s by M^1- = M^11/U(1)
- Keep resulting D2s close together and describe vibrations motions by a 3d B-model.  INterfaces are cuts by M5 branes that become NS5s and D5s.  

This is Aganagic-Anno from this perspective.

Classical Nakajima setup wraps the D4s on one cigar and the NS5s on the other.  Can do this more generally and you get an A_N-type quiver.
