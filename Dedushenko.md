QFT in d=1,2,3

- 1d = QM on R
- 2d on $R \times S^1$
- 3d on $R \times E_\tau$

## SQM

$X =$ Riemannian manifold

$H = \Omega(X)$, norm is 
$\langle \psi_1,\psi_2\rangle = \int_X * \bar \psi_1 \wedge \psi_2$

$Q = d$  

$Q^\dagger = d^\* $

$H = \frac 12 \nabla = dd^\* + d^\* d$.

Ker(H) is the space of SUSY vacua = $\mathrm{ker} Q \cap \mathrm{ker} Q^\dagger = H_{jK}(X).$  Boring??

## 
f is a Morse function on X [Witten '82](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-17/issue-4/Supersymmetry-and-Morse-theory/10.4310/jdg/1214437492.full)

$Q = d_f = e^{-f} de^f = d + df\lambda$

$Q^\dagger = d^* + \int \nabla f$

$H = (QQ^\dagger + Q^\dagger Q)/2$

SUSY vacua $= H_Q = H(X)$

scale up f to infty means to localize to Crit(f).

Gives MSW complex $C^n$ = algebra generated by critical points of index $n$.  

Then the instantons correspond to gradient flows obtained by solving equations of the form $\dot X - \nabla f$.  A path connecting two points of a different Witten index - if the difference is 1 then it corrsponds to a differential on $C^n$.

## 

Given $\psi \in H$ and evolving via the Schrodinger equation 

$i \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = H\psi$.

Make $f$ time dependent.  Now the supercharge has a time derivative. 

$\frac{d Q}{d t} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + i[H,Q] \neq 0$.

$H_t = (QQ^\dagger + Q^\dagger Q)/2 - i\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + i[H,Q] = 0$

Redefine $\Omega = e^f \psi$

New supercharges $\tilde Q = e^f Q e^{-f} = d$

$\tilde G = e^f Q^\dagger e^{-f} = d^* + 2i\nabla_f$.

New Hamiltonian $\tilde H$ 
equals half the commutator of $\tilde Q$ 
and $\tilde H$.

## 

draws an instanton for m as a function of t.  

Make things equivariant... 

Now we do some Morse functions (missed a bunch here)

Exercise $X = \mathbb{C}$ acted on by $U(1)$.  $f = m|z|^2/2$

A harder example with $X = \mathbb{C}^2$ and the morse functionif $f = (|z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2)/2$.  

As $m \to \pm \infty$, 
$\Omega$ supported on the attractor points Attr(0).

## 

X = hyperkahler.  Has a moment map $ \mu_R^f $ for the global (flavor) symmetry $A$.
Morse function $f = \langle m(t),\mu_R^f\rangle$

$T = A\times U(1)_\hbar$

T-fixed points $= Crit(f)$

Conjecture: $\Omega_p^{(m)} = e^f \\Psi_p(m)
