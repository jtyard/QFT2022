define a family of N=4 3d QFT that admit topological twists of type A.  THey argue that the boundary VOAs ar e the Feigin-Tipunin logarithmic VOAs FT_k(sl_n) (k is a level-like parameter).  Based on the idea of corner VOAs.

The 3d boundaries in 4d N=4 SYM can meet at 2d corners.  Can do a twist that leaves the 4d bulk topological while still leaving the corners holomorphic, giving a corner VOA.  Expect to realize it as a boundary of a 3d theory. [Gaiotto-Frenkel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00203)

Aut of the FT-algebra is the Langlands dual G^v = PGL(n,C) and the conformal blocks admit twisting with G^v-local systems.  2^g k^{3g-3}-dimensional spaces of conformal blocks for generic twists (expected).  Related to semisimplification of nonsimple TQFTs from Uq(sl2) at q=exp(pi i/k).  See [Creutzig-Dimofte-Garner-Geer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01559) for more details on this!
