An oper is a connection together with a holomorphic section such that  $\sum [D_z, D_{\bar z}] = 0$.  Useful for the B-model. The space of opers is a subspace of the space of flat connections.  

Line defects = wilson lines along which you can compute the holonomy of a flat connection.  

Fundamental Wilson lines must end on something that transforms in the fundamental = defining representation of SL(2).  Or they can land on the symmetric powers of it.  

It would be really cool to rephrase what we know about geometric langlands in this language of line operators.  

The 4d theory has a whole family of twists besides the A and B twists. Associated to quantum geometric Langlands.  

The more general twists depend on a complex parameter $\psi$.  This 4d theory has BCs and all the natural ones are topological.   Given two 3d TBFTs, the 2d interface between them often is holomorphic hBFT i.e. Kac-Moody or W-algebras.  Can have lines that live on the boundary or otherwise surfaces that extend into the bulk.  Some kinds of lines may give Weyl modules.  OPThers give spectral flow modules.  Intersection with surfaces can give Verma modules.  

The KM algebra has a spectral flow automorphism.

Ends the talk by promising that constructions in geometric Langlands like Hecke operators/correspondences etc can be built in 4d from attaching wilson lines between holomorphic and antiholomorphic 3d boundaries.  I think these 3d boundaries are $\beta,\gamma$ systems. YOu can put topological interfaces in-between.

Something has a regular singularity on the theta divisor.  He says he could do it in one example so far and got something modular invariant.
