Kevin talked about twists of 3d theories, their EOMs and geometric quantization.

The goal of this talk is to give more general context away from 3d. 

## Classical BV formalism

Input data for Lagrangian formalism of $d$-dimensional field theory
- Spacetime: $d$-manifold $M$ 
- Fields: $F = F(M)$ space of sections of a bundle over $M$
- Action functional $S : F \to C$. 

Output of classical field theory 
- $Crit(S) = \{\psi \in F  d\psi = 0}$

Example: CS theory
- $M$ is a 3-manifold
- $F = \Omega^1(M,g)$ space of connections
- $S : F \to C$
$$A \mapsto \frac 12 \int \langle A,dA\rangle + \frac 16 \int_M\langle A,[A,A] \rangle$$
